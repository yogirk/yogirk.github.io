> With sufficient imagination a man could write a whole series of versions of his life; it would form a union of sets in which the facts would be the only elements in common. People, even intelligent people, who are young, and therefore inexperienced and naïve, see only cynicism in such a possibility. They are mistaken, because the problem is not moral but cognitive. The number of metaphysical beliefs is no greater or less than the number of different beliefs a man may entertain on the subject of himself – sequentially, at various periods of his life, and occasionally even at the same time

\-- **Stanisław Lem,**  [His Master's Voice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28763.His_Master_s_Voice) 

So there! There is nothing worth knowing about me. But if you are interested, here are some worldly details. I am RK, a Cloud / Data Architect by experience. 

As of now, I am a programmer with expertise in System Programming (especially C++), who is also interested in Computer Graphics, Compiler Design, and Some Embedded Systems. \[\[Here::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet\]\] is my coding scratchpad if you are interested.

Over the course of time, I have developed interest in many things including cognitive science, mathematics, and philosophy; and my personal penchant is to one day create a software system that I call the CogShell (Short for the  Cognitive Shell\[\[See my writeup on it: [here](/posts/cogshell)::rsn\]\]): A highly interconnnected software toolkit with all the essential tools to support thought continuity through tacit object permanance.

I have a podcast by the same name called the "\[\[Knowledge Continuum::https://open.spotify.com/show/5zR7IUdCZAtP0m4Ef8bMgs\]\]".

### FAQ

\[\[**First Design**<img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg"/>::lmn\]\]Why is the website structured the way it is?

{:.boxit}

> The design of the website is inspired by multiple sources with the intention of making the website more functional. Having said that, I am not a skilled front-end developer/UI-developer, so I could only come somewhat closer to my inital design that I sketched _(see left or click on this ⊕ icon beside the question above if you are on a mobile device)_, hopefully this will clear why it's structured the way it is. In fact, I had to remove the lab option because of my current inability to design it. That said, I can also safely say that I am improving based on the initial iterations of the website that can be seen here: \[\[Jan-22-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200122164405/raghuveer.net\]\], \[\[Apr-13-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200413193808/raghuveer.net\]\], \[\[Apr-20-2020::https://web.archive.org/web/20200420172058/raghuveer.net\]\]
